# Wikipedia Pageviews Analysis Project

## Overview

In this project, you will use Python and Google BigQuery to analyze Wikipedia pageviews for a specific time period. We'll leverage the capabilities of Google Colab for seamless integration with BigQuery and powerful data analysis using Python.

### Objectives

1. Authenticate to Google Colab and BigQuery.
2. Explore the available dataset in BigQuery (e.g., `bigquery-public-data.wikipedia.pageviews_2024`).
3. Write and execute SQL queries to extract relevant data.
4. Perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.
5. Create visualizations, such as histograms, time series plots, word clouds, and more.
6. Gain insights into Wikipedia pageviews trends and patterns.

## Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Google Colab

1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.
2. Create a new notebook: `File` > `New Notebook`.
3. Change the notebook name to something meaningful.

### Step 2: Authenticate Google Colab and BigQuery

```python
from google.colab import auth

# Authenticate Google Colab
auth.authenticate_user()
